# Checkouts

Checkouts redirect your customer to Vatly's hosted payment page. After payment, the customer is redirected back to your application.

## Creating a checkout

```php
$checkout = $user->checkout()->create(
    items: [['id' => 'product_abc123', 'quantity' => 1]],
    redirectUrlSuccess: 'https://your-app.com/success',
    redirectUrlCanceled: 'https://your-app.com/canceled',
);

return redirect($checkout->links->checkoutUrl->href);
```

`$checkout` is a `Vatly\API\Resources\Checkout` — see [vatly-api-php](https://github.com/Vatly/vatly-api-php) for the full resource shape.

## Subscription checkouts

For subscriptions, use the `subscribe()` builder. Redirect URLs default to those in `config/vatly.php` so the call can be just one line:

```php
$checkout = $user->subscribe()
    ->toPlan('subscription_plan_monthly')
    ->create();

return redirect($checkout->links->checkoutUrl->href);
```

## Checkout with metadata

```php
$checkout = $user->checkout()
    ->withMetadata(['campaign' => 'summer-2025'])
    ->create(
        items: [['id' => 'product_abc123', 'quantity' => 1]],
        redirectUrlSuccess: 'https://your-app.com/success',
        redirectUrlCanceled: 'https://your-app.com/canceled',
    );
```

## Checkout language (locale)

Set `locale` to present the hosted checkout — including its validation and error messages — in the customer's language. Do this when you already know their language: it is a better signal than their browser's, and it carries through to the payment provider's own hosted page.

`create()` takes a fourth argument, `payloadOverrides`, that is merged into the checkout payload, so pass `locale` there:

```php
$checkout = $user->checkout()->create(
    items: [['id' => 'product_abc123', 'quantity' => 1]],
    redirectUrlSuccess: 'https://your-app.com/success',
    redirectUrlCanceled: 'https://your-app.com/canceled',
    payloadOverrides: ['locale' => 'de'],
);
```

For the subscription flow, `subscribe()->create()` takes the same overrides:

```php
$checkout = $user->subscribe()
    ->toPlan('subscription_plan_monthly')
    ->create(['locale' => 'de']);
```

Send a bare language code (`de`), a BCP 47 tag (`de-AT`), or a POSIX / ISO 15897 locale (`de_DE`) — whichever your stack already stores. All three fold to the language, so `de`, `de-AT` and `de_DE` are the same request; there are no region-specific variants. Leave `locale` unset to let Vatly fall back to the customer's browser language.

## How it works

The checkout flow:

1. Your app creates a checkout session via the Vatly API (customer is created automatically if needed)
2. The customer is redirected to Vatly's hosted payment page
3. After payment, the customer returns to your `redirectUrlSuccess`
4. Vatly sends a webhook to confirm the payment (see [Webhooks](/packages/laravel/webhooks))
5. If this was a new customer, the customer ID is synced to your local database via webhook

The redirect URLs default to the values in your `vatly.php` config but can be overridden per checkout.
