# Vs Cashier (Stripe, Paddle) & Lemon Squeezy

Picking the billing layer for a new Laravel app? If you've reached for Laravel Cashier
before, Vatly will feel immediately familiar — a `Billable` trait, `subscribed()`,
`subscription()->swap()`, a wired-up webhook endpoint. The difference is what sits *behind*
the API: Vatly is a **Merchant of Record**, so it is the legal seller and handles VAT,
invoicing, and payment compliance for you — and it's **Europe-first**, operating under EU
jurisdiction.

This page is an honest, side-by-side look at how `vatly-laravel` stacks up against the
Cashier-style packages you might otherwise reach for —
[Laravel Cashier (Stripe)](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/billing),
[Laravel Cashier (Paddle)](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/cashier-paddle), and
[Lemon Squeezy for Laravel](https://github.com/lmsqueezy/laravel) — gaps included.

> [!NOTE]
> **Already running one of these in an existing app?** This page helps you choose. Once you
> have, [Migrating from Cashier](Migrating-to-Vatly.md) shows how to add Vatly
> next to your current biller and migrate customers over gradually.

## At a glance

| | Cashier (Stripe Billing) | Cashier (Paddle) | Lemon Squeezy | **Vatly** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Composer package | `laravel/cashier` | `laravel/cashier-paddle` | `lemonsqueezy/laravel` | `vatly/vatly-laravel` |
| Billable trait | `Laravel\Cashier\Billable` | `Laravel\Paddle\Billable` | `LemonSqueezy\Laravel\Billable` | `Vatly\Laravel\Billable` |
| Merchant of Record | **No** — you are the seller | Yes | Yes | **Yes (full)** |
| Entity / jurisdiction | *You* (wherever you're registered) | Paddle, **UK** | Lemon Squeezy, **US** (Stripe-owned) | **EEA / EU jurisdiction** |
| Who remits VAT/sales tax | **You** (Stripe Tax only *calculates*) | Provider | Provider | **Provider** |
| Customer stored as | columns on the billable model (`stripe_id`, …) | `customers` table (`paddle_id`) | `lemon_squeezy_customers` table | `vatly_id` column on the billable model + `vatly_*` tables |
| Checkout | Stripe Checkout (hosted) / Elements | Paddle.js **overlay / inline** (client-side JS) | Lemon.js overlay / hosted URL | **Vatly-hosted redirect** (+ guest claim) |
| Webhook route | `/stripe/webhook` | `/paddle/webhook` | `/lemon-squeezy/webhook` | `/webhooks/vatly` |
| Coupons / promo codes | Yes | Yes | Yes | **On the roadmap** (workaround below) |
| License keys | No | No | Yes | **On the roadmap** (rarely needed for SaaS) |
| Refunds & chargebacks | wire it yourself | events | events | **first-class models + events** |
| Trials, swap, grace/resume | Yes | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |

Two takeaways:

1. **With `laravel/cashier`, *you're* the seller of record.** It runs on classic Stripe Billing, so
   you register for VAT, file, and remit in every market you sell into — the compliance and the
   liability sit with your company. (Stripe's own Merchant-of-Record product,
   [Managed Payments](https://stripe.com/managed-payments), is a separate, US-based service you'd
   integrate instead — not the Cashier subscriptions you're building on.)
2. **So the real difference between MoRs is jurisdiction.** Paddle is UK, Lemon Squeezy and Stripe
   are US, Vatly is EEA — your seller-of-record entity and customer data stay under EU law. That,
   not the API, is the reason to choose one over another.

## The developer experience

For a greenfield app, Vatly is your only biller — so you use the plain `Billable` trait, and
the code reads like Cashier:

```php
use Vatly\Laravel\Billable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Billable;
}
```

```php
// Start a subscription — redirect to Vatly's hosted checkout
$checkout = $user->subscribe()
    ->toPlan('subscription_plan_7Hd9Kf2Lm')
    ->withTrialDays(14)
    ->create();

return redirect($checkout->links->checkoutUrl->href);

// Gate features on subscription state
if ($user->subscribed()) {
    // …
}

$user->subscription()->swap('subscription_plan_other');
$user->subscription()->cancel();      // Vatly decides immediate vs. grace
$user->subscription()->resume();      // while on the grace period

// One-off purchase
$user->checkout()->create(
    items: [['id' => 'one_off_product_3Qb8Wz1Yt', 'quantity' => 1]],
    redirectUrlSuccess: route('billing.success'),
    redirectUrlCanceled: route('billing'),
);

// Receipts — hosted invoice URLs, no PDF plumbing
foreach ($user->orders as $order) {
    echo $order->invoiceUrl();
}
```

No VAT logic, no tax tables, no invoice templates, no client-side checkout widget to embed —
the checkout is a server-side redirect, like Stripe Checkout. See [Subscriptions](Subscriptions.md)
and [Checkouts](Checkouts.md) for the full surface.

## Feature parity, and what's still on the roadmap

Vatly covers what a SaaS needs to start selling: subscriptions with trials, plan swaps,
cancellation with grace and resume, one-off purchases, hosted checkout, refunds and chargebacks,
and — because it's a Merchant of Record — VAT, invoicing and tax compliance handled for you. A
few capabilities you may use elsewhere aren't in the box yet. Here's the honest picture, and how
to bridge it.

| Capability | Vatly today | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Subscriptions, trials, swap, grace, resume | ✅ | Full lifecycle, Cashier-shaped API |
| One-off / multi-item checkout | ✅ | `checkout()->create(items: …)` |
| VAT, invoicing, tax remittance | ✅ | Handled — it's the point of a MoR. With Cashier (classic Stripe Billing) this is *your* job. |
| Refunds & chargebacks | ✅ | First-class models + events (more than most provide) |
| Test / live segregation | ✅ | Every record carries `testmode`; key prefix selects the mode |
| **Coupons / promo codes** | 🔜 Roadmap | Until native codes land, model a promo as a dedicated `subscription_plan_…` at the discounted price and point that cohort at it. A couple of extra plans in the dashboard — not a blocker for launching offers. |
| **License keys** | 🔜 Roadmap | Vatly is built for SaaS, where entitlement follows subscription state — `subscribed()` *is* your license check. Per-seat keys for downloadable/offline software (Lemon Squeezy's signature feature) aren't here yet. If you ship license-activated desktop binaries, that's the one workflow to keep elsewhere for now. |

The shape of the trade is deliberate: Vatly does the compliance-heavy core that's genuinely
hard to build — being the seller of record, VAT across the EU, invoicing, disputes — and is
filling in the conveniences (coupons next) in the open. For a subscription SaaS selling into
Europe and the world, there's enough here to launch today.

## Why teams choose Vatly

A Merchant of Record makes the tax burden disappear — it becomes the legal seller, so VAT,
invoicing and remittance stop being your problem. The real question is *whose* entity you hand that
to, and that's where Vatly stands apart:

- **Europe-first, by design.** EEA-based, EU jurisdiction, customer data kept in Europe. The other
  MoRs sit in the UK (Paddle) or the US (Lemon Squeezy, Stripe Managed Payments) — jurisdiction is
  the one axis that genuinely separates them, and the reason Vatly exists.
- **No exposure to US policy.** Your seller-of-record relationship and your customers' data stay
  under EU law — a clean answer when an enterprise buyer, or your own board, asks where they sit.
- **One familiar API.** The Cashier-shaped surface means there's little to learn and little to
  rewrite.
