# Customers

Every billable model can be linked to a Vatly customer. Customers are created automatically by Vatly during checkout and synced to your application via webhooks. You can also create customers explicitly if needed.

## Creating a customer

```php
// Create a Vatly customer for this user
$user->createAsVatlyCustomer();

// Create with extra data
$user->createAsVatlyCustomer([
    'locale' => 'nl_NL',
    'metadata' => ['internal_id' => $user->id],
]);
```

## Checking customer status

```php
// Check if the user has a Vatly customer ID
$user->hasVatlyId(); // bool

// Get the Vatly customer ID
$user->getVatlyId(); // string|null
```

## Retrieving customer data

```php
// Get the full customer object from the Vatly API
$customer = $user->asVatlyCustomer();
```

## Updating customer identity

Update the customer's `name` and/or `email` at Vatly (both optional — send
whichever changed). Billing-address details (company name, tax id, street, …)
are **not** editable here; send the customer through the hosted billing-update
flow for those.

```php
$customer = $user->updateVatlyCustomer([
    'name' => 'Jane Doe',
    'email' => 'jane@example.com',
]);
```

Throws `NoVatlyCustomerException` if the user has no Vatly customer yet.

## How it works

The `vatly_id` column on your billable model stores the Vatly customer identifier. When you call `createAsVatlyCustomer()`, it:

1. Sends a `POST` request to the Vatly API to create a customer
2. Stores the returned customer ID in the `vatly_id` column
3. Returns the customer response

If the user already has a `vatly_id`, calling `createAsVatlyCustomer()` will throw a `CustomerAlreadyBoundException`.

## Automatic customer creation

When a user starts a checkout without an existing Vatly customer ID, Vatly creates the customer automatically during the checkout flow. The customer ID is synced back to your application via webhooks.

This means you don't need to call `createAsVatlyCustomer()` before starting a checkout — just redirect the user directly.

## Anonymous / guest checkouts

A common flow: a visitor buys *before* they sign up — checkout completes, Vatly fires `order.paid` / `subscription.started` webhooks, and your app has no `User` row to attribute the purchase to yet.

The package handles this without losing data:

- The `vatly_subscriptions` and `vatly_orders` tables both have a nullable `owner_id`/`owner_type` plus a `customer_id` column. The webhook writes the row with `owner_id = null` but populates `customer_id` with the Vatly customer id (`cus_…`).
- When the visitor returns on the checkout-success redirect, call `claimVatlyCustomerFromReturn()` to link those rows to the now-known user.

### Learning the checkout on the redirect back: the `{CHECKOUT_ID}` placeholder

The one hard part of guest checkout is: *how does your app know which Vatly customer to claim when the buyer lands back on your site?* You don't have to plumb the `cus_…` through a session or cookie yourself (that approach breaks under multi-tab / double-click — the last write wins, and the buyer may finish the checkout that *isn't* in the session).

Instead, put the literal `{CHECKOUT_ID}` placeholder in your return URL. Vatly substitutes it with the checkout's id at creation:

```php
$user->checkout()->create(
    items: [['id' => 'product_abc123', 'quantity' => 1]],
    redirectUrlSuccess: route('vatly.return').'?checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}',
    redirectUrlCanceled: route('billing'),
);
```

On the return route, hand the request to `claimVatlyCustomerFromReturn()`:

```php
public function return(Request $request)
{
    // Reads ?checkout_id=…, resolves that checkout's Vatly customer, and
    // (if there is one) claims it for the authenticated user.
    $request->user()->claimVatlyCustomerFromReturn($request);

    return redirect()->route('dashboard');
}
```

It returns `true` when a claim happened and `false` for a missing / unknown checkout id or a checkout with no customer yet — so it's safe to call unconditionally. Pass a second argument to read a different query key:

```php
$user->claimVatlyCustomerFromReturn($request, 'cid'); // reads ?cid=…
```

This is **multi-tab safe by construction**: each tab carries its own checkout id in its own redirect URL, so two checkouts in flight resolve independently — there is no shared carrier whose last write wins.

> [!NOTE]
> The checkout id travels in the URL, so it may also appear in the `Referer` header and your server logs. It is low-sensitivity — it only names a checkout the buyer just completed — but treat it like any URL parameter.

Under the hood `claimVatlyCustomerFromReturn()` resolves the checkout's customer id via the Vatly API and then runs `claimVatlyCustomer()`, which:

1. Binds the Vatly customer id to this host entity via the configured `CustomerBindingRepository` (default impl: writes `vatly_id` on the billable table).
2. Saves the model.
3. Backfills `owner_type` / `owner_id` on every `vatly_subscriptions` and `vatly_orders` row that carries the same `customer_id` but had no owner yet.

The `order.paid` / `subscription.started` webhook usually lands *before* the buyer is redirected back, so those rows already exist (with `owner_id = null`) by the time you claim — step 3 simply backfills them. The reverse order works too: if the claim runs first, it binds the customer, and a later webhook for the same `customer_id` finds the binding and writes `owner_id` directly. Either way the purchase ends up attributed.

If you already hold the `cus_…` by other means, you can still call `claimVatlyCustomer($vatlyCustomerId)` directly; it returns the number of rows re-attributed.

> [!NOTE]
> **Out of scope:** buyers who never come back via the redirect link (closed the tab, switched device). Recovering those is the email-based recovery story — a separate concern this helper does not cover.

Need the email / name on the customer to surface a "would you like to claim purchase X?" prompt at signup? Fetch the customer via the Vatly API:

```php
$customer = app(\Vatly\Fluent\Vatly::class)
    ->customers()
    ->findByVatlyCustomerId($vatlyCustomerId);

$customer->email;
$customer->name;
```
