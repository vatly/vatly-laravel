# Subscriptions

Vatly Laravel provides a full subscription lifecycle: creating, checking, swapping plans, canceling, and syncing with the Vatly API.

## Starting a subscription

```php
$checkout = $user->subscribe()
    ->toPlan('plan_premium')
    ->create();

return redirect($checkout->links->checkoutUrl->href);
```

### With a free trial

Trials defer the first charge until the trial elapses. Set them on the builder, in whole days or by end date:

```php
// Whole days from checkout creation
$user->subscribe()
    ->toPlan('plan_premium')
    ->withTrialDays(14)
    ->create();

// Or an end date — the remaining time is rounded *up* to whole days, so the
// trial never ends earlier than requested (Vatly's trial input is day-granular)
$user->subscribe()
    ->toPlan('plan_premium')
    ->withTrialEndsAt(now()->addMonth())
    ->create();
```

`withTrialDays()` throws for a length below 1 day; `withTrialEndsAt()` throws for a date that isn't in the future. When no trial is set the checkout payload omits `trialDays` entirely, so any plan-level default at Vatly still applies.

## Checking subscription status

```php
// Check if the user is subscribed
$user->subscribed(); // bool
$user->subscribed('premium'); // check a specific subscription type

// Get the subscription as a fluent handle (operations live here)
$subscription = $user->subscription(); // default type, returns ?SubscriptionHandle
$subscription = $user->subscription('premium');

// Get all subscriptions as Eloquent models (state-only)
$subscriptions = $user->subscriptions; // Collection<Subscription>
```

`$user->subscription('default')` returns a `Vatly\Fluent\SubscriptionHandle` — a lightweight wrapper around the underlying Eloquent model that exposes API-driven operations (`swap`, `cancel`, `sync`, `updateBilling`). Reach the Eloquent model via `$subscription->model()` if you need it directly.

## Subscription state

```php
$subscription->active();       // currently active (including grace period)
$subscription->cancelled();    // has been cancelled
$subscription->onGracePeriod(); // cancelled but still active until ends_at
```

## Swapping plans

```php
// Swap to a new plan
$user->subscription()->swap('subscription_plan_annual');

// Swap and invoice immediately (prorated)
$user->subscription()->swapAndInvoice('subscription_plan_annual');
```

## Canceling

```php
// Cancel the subscription at Vatly
$user->subscription()->cancel();
```

The actual cancellation is processed via webhooks. Depending on the Vatly configuration, the subscription may:

- End immediately (`SubscriptionCanceledImmediately` event)
- Enter a grace period (`SubscriptionCanceledWithGracePeriod` event)

## Updating billing details

```php
// Create a signed URL where the customer can update their billing details
// (address, VAT number, company name). Going through the hosted flow also
// refreshes the Mollie mandate as a side effect.
$url = $user->subscription()->updateBilling();

return redirect($url);
```

## Syncing with Vatly

Pull the latest subscription data from the Vatly API:

```php
$user->subscription()->sync();
```

This updates the local `plan_id`, `name`, `quantity`, `ends_at`, and `trial_ends_at` fields.

## Subscription types

You can have multiple subscriptions per user by using types:

```php
// A user with both a "default" and "addon" subscription
$user->subscription('default'); // main plan
$user->subscription('addon');   // additional features
```

The default type is `'default'`.
